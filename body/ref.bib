Their operation is based on multi-dimensional bend measurements using a series of fibre optic sensors. Optical fibre sensors have experienced tremendous growth from simple bend sensors in 1980s to full three-dimensional FOSSs using multicore fibres in recent years. Following a short review of conventional contact-based shape sensor technologies, the evolution trend and sensing principles of FOSSs are presented. This paper identifies the major optical fibre technologies used for shape sensing and provides an account of the challenges and emerging applications of FOSSs in various industries such as medical robotics, industrial robotics, aerospace and mining industry."

Within a multicored fibre (30, 32, 34), cores (62, 66) are grouped in non-coplanar pairs. An arrangement of optical elements (28, 36, 38) define within each core pair (62, 66) two optical paths (122, 124) which differ along the sensor length (30): one core (62) of a pair (62, 66) is included in the first path (122), and the other core (66) in the second path (124). A general bending of the sensor region (30) will lengthen one core (62, 66) with respect to the other. Interrogation of this length differential by means of interferometry generates interferograms form which the degree of bending in the plane of the core pair is extracted. Bend orientation can be deduced from data extracted from multiple core pairs.},

Two demodulation schemes are used, namely a single-sensor locked mode interrogation technique which permits vibrational analysis and a scanning multi-sensor approach for beam shape determination. Static beam deformation prediction is performed using a Rayleigh - Ritz type analysis with three optimized trial functions and the strain information obtained from the fibre Bragg grating sensors. The strain information is read into a PC which performs the shape modelling of the beam.}

Because of the particular geometry of the sensing head, it is possible not only to measure the radius of curvature but also to determine the plane of curvature. We arrange three Bragg gratings in the vertices of the smallest equilateral triangle that can be defined by the cross sections of the fibers. The set is then inserted into a glue-filled capillary stainless-steel tube to provide both suitable protection for the Bragg sensors and rotational symmetry to the sensing head. This tube also ensures isolation from axial strain, allowing for the additional determination of temperature. The proposed sensing head is particularly well suited for applications in smart structures because it can be embedded along any layer of a composite material (including the neutral line) without special concern for the relative orientation of the Bragg gratings and the composite layers. We can also use this sensing configuration to implement more-sophisticated sensors dedicated, for example, to the measurement of multiaxial acceleration or flow and temperature.},

	abstract = {A robust and efficient computational method for reconstructing the elastodynamic structural response of truss, beam, and frame structures, using measured surface-strain data, is presented. Known as “shape sensing”, this inverse problem has important implications for real-time actuation and control of smart structures, and for monitoring of structural integrity. The present formulation, based on the inverse Finite Element Method (iFEM), uses a least-squares variational principle involving section strains (also known as strain measures) of Timoshenko theory for stretching, torsion, bending, and transverse shear. The present iFEM methodology is based on strain–displacement relations only, without invoking force equilibrium. Consequently, both static and time-varying displacement fields can be reconstructed without the knowledge of material properties, applied loading, or damping characteristics. Two finite elements capable of modeling frame structures are derived using interdependent interpolations, in which interior degrees of freedom are condensed out at the element level. In addition, relationships between the order of kinematic-element interpolations and the number of required strain gauges are established. Several example problems involving cantilevered beams and three-dimensional frame structures undergoing static and dynamic response are discussed. To simulate experimentally measured strains and to establish reference displacements, high-fidelity MSC/NASTRAN finite element analyses are performed. Furthermore, numerically simulated measurement errors, based on Gaussian distribution, are also considered in order to verify the stability and robustness of the methodology. The iFEM solution accuracy is examined with respect to various levels of discretization and the number of strain gauges.},

The fiber optic strain sensing technology was recently proposed by the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. The methodology implements the use of fiber optic sensors to obtain strain measurements from the target structure and to estimate the corresponding displacement field. In this paper, the methodology is investigated through an experimental aluminum winglike swept-plate model. The proposed algorithm is implemented for three distinct loading cases and compared to a well-established modal-based shape-estimation algorithm. The estimation results from both methods are also compared to reference displacements from photogrammetry and computational analyses. The estimation error for each method is quantified using the root-mean-square measure, and the range of validity of the approach for damage detection is established. Furthermore, the disadvantages and the advantages of each method are discussed, demonstrating the additional benefits of using the proposed fiber optic strain sensing methodology to achieve a robust method for monitoring ultra-lightweight flying wings or next-generation commercial airplanes. }

abstract = {A theoretical and experimental study on the response of Brillouin scattering in multi-core optical fibers (MCF) under different curving conditions is presented. Results demonstrate that the Brillouin frequency shift of the off-center cores in MCF is highly bending-dependent, showing a linear dependence on the fiber curvature. This feature is here exploited to develop a new kind of distributed optical fiber sensor, which provides measurements of a distributed profile mapping the longitudinal fiber shape. Using conventional Brillouin optical time-domain analysis with differential pulse-width pairs, fully distributed shape sensing along a 1 km-long MCF is practically demonstrated. Experimental results show a very good agreement with the theoretically expected behavior deduced from the dependence of the Brillouin frequency on the strain induced by the fiber bending over a given core. The analysis and results presented in this paper constitute the first demonstration of distributed bending sensing, providing the cornerstone to further develop it into a fully distributed three-dimensional shape sensor.},
